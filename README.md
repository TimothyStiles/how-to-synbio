# How to Synbio :dna:

Hello everyone!

My name is [Tim](https://github.com/sponsors/TimothyStiles/) and I'm the creator of [Poly](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly), an open source Go library for engineering organisms.

We onboard new software engineers all the time who want to learn about synthetic biology while also making meaningful contributions to what is quickly becoming the greatest open source synbio software library around.

This is just the beginning our of resources doc. The field is moving fast and things may not be complete. If you think we're missing something let us know by opening an issue or even go ahead and make a pull request if you feel like adding resources and editing.

Also, feel free to join our project [discord](https://discord.gg/Hc8Ncwt). We're a pretty great group and always love having new people jump onto our server to play a little supertuxkart and hack.

Happy hacking!

Tim

## Resources

Synbio doesn't really have a definitive textbook since the field moves too fast.

Instead we have these.

* [The Addgene blog](https://blog.addgene.org/)
* [The iGEM getting started docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QgCZptGm8_tyh-AekqPVRgz2l9b16H52FvtLYDTIVlo/edit#slide=id.g8c052aa16e_0_43)
* [Biorxiv synbio feed for latest publications](https://www.biorxiv.org/collection/synthetic-biology)
* [How to research almost anything](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/how-to-research-almost-anything) 
* [Immaculate comments and commentary directly integrated into Poly's source code](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly)
* [Book 3, chapters 10 and 13 of Life on Earth by EO Wilson](https://books.apple.com/us/book/e-o-wilsons-life-on-earth-unit-3/id888132076) (Looking for replacement)

For the most part this is what you need to get started. Also, consider hanging out at your [local biohacker/diybio space](https://sphere.diybio.org/browse/?q=&idx=diybiosphere&p=0&dFR%5Bcollection%5D%5B0%5D=labs) if you have one.
Cheap access to lab space and there's usually friendly people around who may be happy to explain stuff.
